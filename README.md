# FlashQuiz

Flash Quiz makes studying anything fun – even on the go!

Search for flashcard sets on Quizlet.com and select from thousands of subjects. Or create your own sets on Quizlet and then take them with you with FlashQuiz.
You can add flashcard sets to your own personal “My Sets” list for quick retrieval without having to search again. The new version brings a more attractive interface and uses Windows Phone’s unique Pivot view to switch between My Sets and Find Sets.

Here are a couple of screenshots from the app:
